# Sex_specific_declines_2023 / tRF_Targets
This project supports the work in 'Sex-specific declines in cholinergic-targeting tRNA fragments in the nucleus accumbens in Alzheimer’s disease' by Shulman et al.
Predicted targets of the tRFs by the DIANA microT prediction tool.

# Data discription:
The predicted targets of the identified tRFs were determined using the prediction algorithm of the MR-microT DIANA tool based on sequence motif. The likelihood of binding the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) and protein coding sequences (CDS) of each targeted mRNA was calculated separately, combined to a prediction score that was normalized by the conservation of the binding site in a number of species. Targets with prediction score < 0.8 were extracted.
