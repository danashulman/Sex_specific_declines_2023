Cell splitting was performed weekly at 80% confluency.",total RNA,"Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol lysis with 1 ml of TRIzol per well. RNA was precipitated with pure Ethanol and washed with 85% Ethanol, according to the manufacturers instructions.","An even amount of 150 ng RNA per sample was used for small-RNA library construction using the New England BioLabs NEB-next multiplex small-RNA library construction kit. The library was size selected based on DNA 1000 LabChip kits by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) results to 146 bp long transcripts which include the barcodes, adaptors and ca. 20 bp long miRs. This ensures that sequenced transcripts are in the maximum length of 30 bp only. Libraries were quantified using the highly sensitive fluorescent dye-based Qubit® ds DNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing was run in The NextSeq Series desktop sequencing system of the Illumina platform (all 48 samples on one chip). The number of Pass Filter reads per sample was at the range of (13-14*10^6 reads). Read counts and quality for each sample were evaluated with the BaseSpace Sequencing QC report tool.",9606,Small RNA sequencing,processed data file: mirexpress2_counts_raw.csv,"Adapter trim and quality filtering using flexbar 3.4.0, miRBase alignment: miRExpress 2.1.4: Data parse (“Raw_data_parse”), statistics generation (“statistics_reads”), alignment (“alignmentSIMD”, “analysis”).",Count readout for all alignments: R/Rsubread 1.28.1,Genome_build: miRBase v21,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: mirexpress2_counts_raw.csv: Comma-delimited text file contains raw count values.
